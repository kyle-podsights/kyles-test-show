# Kyle's Test Show
This repo is used to host Kyle's Test Show to experiment with RSS Feeds.

## Formatting
The feed follows the [RSS 2.0 specification version](https://cyber.harvard.edu/rss/rss.html).

## Testing
After updating the feed.xml I would use the [W3C Validation service](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) to ensure the feed was valid

## Getting the Podcast Published to Google Podcast
I'm aiming to get the Test Show up on Google Podcasts via using PubSubHubbub with documents/notes found [here](https://support.google.com/podcast-publishers/answer/9890138?ref_topic=10308237)
